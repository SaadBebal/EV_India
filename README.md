EV Charging Stations Clustering and Visualization
This project demonstrates how to perform clustering on a dataset of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations using geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). The project includes clustering with the KMeans algorithm and visualization of the clusters on an interactive map using Folium. The main goal is to identify patterns in the locations of EV charging stations by grouping them into distinct clusters.

Project Overview
Features:
Clustering:

Using KMeans clustering to group EV charging stations based on geographical coordinates.
Identification of an optimal number of clusters using the silhouette score.
Visualization:

An interactive map showing the location of EV charging stations.
Different clusters are color-coded for better clarity and interpretation.
Folium is used to display the clusters on a map, and marker clusters are implemented for better map readability.
Tools & Libraries Used:
Python: For data processing and clustering.
Pandas: For handling datasets.
Scikit-learn: For applying the KMeans clustering algorithm.
Matplotlib: For plotting the silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Folium: For visualizing EV charging stations and clusters on an interactive map.
Google Colab: Running and sharing the notebook via the cloud.
