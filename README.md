EV Charging Stations Clustering and Visualization
This project demonstrates how to perform clustering on a dataset of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations using geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). The project includes clustering with the KMeans algorithm and visualization of the clusters on an interactive map using Folium. The main goal is to identify patterns in the locations of EV charging stations by grouping them into distinct clusters.

Project Overview
Features:
Clustering:

Using KMeans clustering to group EV charging stations based on geographical coordinates.
Identification of an optimal number of clusters using the silhouette score.
Visualization:

An interactive map showing the location of EV charging stations.
Different clusters are color-coded for better clarity and interpretation.
Folium is used to display the clusters on a map, and marker clusters are implemented for better map readability.
Tools & Libraries Used:
Python: For data processing and clustering.
Pandas: For handling datasets.
Scikit-learn: For applying the KMeans clustering algorithm.
Matplotlib: For plotting the silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Folium: For visualizing EV charging stations and clusters on an interactive map.
Google Colab: Running and sharing the notebook via the cloud.


#Another project for EV_India 
here is the summary for this 
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file and execute the code to perform data analysis, segmentation, and visualization. The main steps are as follows:

Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset to ensure all numeric values are correctly formatted.
Data Analysis: Calculate total and average electric vehicles.
Segmentation: Categorize states based on EV adoption levels.
Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the data insights.
Methodology
Data Cleaning: Ensure that all data is in the correct format, removing any non-numeric characters and handling missing values.
Data Analysis: Perform calculations to derive insights from the data, such as totals and averages.
Segmentation: Classify states into high, medium, and low EV adoption categories based on quantiles.
Visualization: Generate visual representations of the data for better understanding and communication of findings.
Data Analysis
The analysis includes:

Summation of electric and non-electric vehicle counts.
Average counts of electric vehicles per state.
Categorization of states based on their electric vehicle counts.
Visualizations
This project includes several visualizations, such as:

Bar Plots: Comparing total electric vehicles by state.
Pie Charts: Showing the proportion of states in different EV adoption categories.
Heatmaps: Illustrating the distribution of electric vehicles across states.
Results
The analysis provides insights into:

The total and average electric vehicles in India.
Segmentation of states based on their electric vehicle adoption levels.
Visual representations that highlight trends and comparisons.
